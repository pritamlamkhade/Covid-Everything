                    <p align = 'justify'>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may
                    affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of
                    taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin
                    gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.
                   </p>
                    <p align = 'justify'>Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who
                    gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical
                    problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing
                    serious illness. However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill. People of all ages who experience fever
                    and/or cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement
                    should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility
                    first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.</p>
